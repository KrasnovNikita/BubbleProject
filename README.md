# BubbleProject
Interview task

Write the function for sorting an integer array by the "bubble" method. At the input to the function, we have an integer unsorted array. At the output of the function, we get an array sorted in descending order. When writing the code, we use only the basic language operators, without using libraries or classes such as Collections or Arrays.

Result

In this task I created project for realizing bubble sorting. The method for sorting was named "sortVector" and it's situated in the class BuubleSorting. There are also methods "fillVector" for filling an array with random integer numbers and and "getVector" for getting whole array. In the class StartSorting you can find "main" method from which program starts and other methods are called.
